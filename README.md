This is Zhiyan and her team's work on 2019 Ross Datathon Competition at Umich.

Ross Datathon was a great oppotunity for me at that time as I first officially start coding and analytics. I experienced the whole process of establishing a question, choosing relavant data resources, conduct analysis and finally come to a business report and a presentation.

The competition was a full-day challenge. I led my team of two sophomores and one senior with statistics background. I was the only one from Ross, and that was my first group project that is cross-dicipline, cross-culture and with students of different ages. That was a fun and challenging experience.

The competition was held Feb 22, 2019 at Ross. I was one month into analytics with R, which I knew nothing about simply four weeks before. It was amazing to see my inprovement and intuition with this, which becomes the main reason why I enter into analytics now. Not only did I find my passion there, it also prepared me for my project proposals and ideas later when I was doing my internship. My analytics project then added value to my function, and without the knowledges and Datathon experience from Ross are certainly accountable for my later innovation and capacity.
